<h1> Scraping With Scrapy and Playwright</h1>
<p>This scraper illustrates how to effectively scrape an E-commerce Website using scrapy and playwright.</p>
<p>In this case we are scraping information about each product, that is:
  <li>the product title,</li>
  <li>price, product-url,</li>
  <li>image-urls,</li>
  <li> and the supplier</li> 
</p>
<h3>I just wanted to showcase the concept of scraping a dynamic website.</h3>
<h3> Fork and run pip install -r requirements.txt and also run playwright install chromium(refer to https://playwright.dev/python/docs/browsers).</h3>
<h3>Check scrapy settings if you need to change anything, especially the scrapyops api key.</h3>
<h2>Thank you.</h2>
